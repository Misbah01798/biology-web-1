    "about": "Making an intelligent career choice is important when one passes out of school. It paves the way towards your future destiny. Now that the admission process is on in the colleges after the NEET, JEE, CUET and other competitive exams are out, students are anxious and excited both. Students who have had Biology and appeared in NEET and could not make it, do not get upset, as there are many new avenues, interesting subjects and various universities that offer exciting and well curated courses for you. Students who want to stay connected to nature and work towards human welfare through science-think of becoming a Botanist. Botany, the science of plants, is one of the most exciting disciplines where you can make a wonderful and adventurous career.

    "about": "Zoology is the branch of Biology dedicated to all aspects of animal life – from anatomy and physiology, to evolution and husbandry. It is a subject for those who love animals and those who want to understand how the natural world works. As our awareness of environmental issues grows, and as our governments shift their priorities towards protecting and conserving the environment and wildlife, so will Zoology be an increasingly worthwhile subject to study.",

    "description": "Your study plan should be unique as you know your strengths and weaknesses more than anybody else. So, you should make your own strategy. You have to make a study plan which fits you the best.",
    "about" :"Over-confidence or pessimism- neither worked on me. I just concentrated on my own work. I followed my routine and finished my studies every day. I used to study less, but with concentration. Some might say getting chance in medical admission test requires grueling studies day and night, but that was not the case for me. I tried to go to bed early and resume studies in the morning. I felt getting enough sleep was important for good preparation. I used to spend time in coaching centres up to the afternoon and then spend time with my parents or do something or the other just to unwind.",
